# PyBer_Analysis

## Overiew

This project is related to PyBer, a Taxi service company with many drivers in various cities. This project aims to analyze their city and ride data sets to expose hidden patterns in the number of rides, drivers, and fares for each ride in different areas.

In this analysis, the Panda library is used for data manipulation, and the Matplotlib library is used to visualize outcomes.


## Results

- In the scatter plot, the Size of each circle is based on the number of drivers, and we can see that overall, urban areas have the lowest fare rates and highest number of drives, while Rural areas have the highest fares and lowest number of rides.
